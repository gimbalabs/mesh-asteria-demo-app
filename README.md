# mesh-asteria-demo-app

In Mesh Living Coding Sessions in May 2024, we will build a demo front-end for [TxPipe's Asteria game](https://github.com/txpipe/asteria/)

### Front End
1. UI for all three Transactions, built with Mesh
2. Simple visual for the Asteria game board

### First Three Transactions:
1. Start an Asteria game (with selected parameters)
2. Player can mint a Ship and Pilot token pair
3. Player can move a Ship

### Next Steps
- Before next meeting on 2024-05-07: initial project repo with all dependencies (James)
- On 2024-05-07: Build transactions (1) and (2)
  - Might need to mint an Admin token before that - James will have one ready
